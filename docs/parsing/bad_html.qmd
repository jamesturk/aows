## Bad HTML

We saw in the performance comparison that the results of counting particular nodes differed somewhat between parsers.

If you've written more than a few scrapers you've likely encountered some, "creative" HTML.
Because browsers are so forgiving, it's not uncommon to see HTML that doesn't conform to the spec.

While some things like redundant tags are inconveniences, at worst making your scraper code a bit more complex, some messy HTML can cause parsing errors.

A missing closing tag, or in some cases a single character typo, can cause a parser to fail to correctly parse the rest of the document.
When this happens the scraper author is left with the choice to either fall back to crude techniques to "fix" the HTML, or to use another parser.
